hello?
 
I cant work on any of the vent device. moving to other issues
 
sorry?
 
What are you talking about with me?
 
I cant find any Vent Device? Can you tell me on which url should i look for it?
 
I've told you several times since this morning to fix the device, and when I asked you what you were doing, you said you were developing a vent device
 
I am. but I need a actual vent device for the testing
